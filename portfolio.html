                <p>In the United States, electricians are divided into two primary categories: lineperson, who work on
                    electric utility company distribution systems at higher voltages, and wiremen, who work with the
                    lower voltages utilized inside buildings. Wiremen are generally trained in one of five primary
                    specialties: commercial, residential, light industrial, industrial, and low-voltage wiring, more
                    commonly known as Voice-Data-Video, or VDV. Other sub-specialties such as control wiring and
                    fire-alarm may be performed by specialists trained in the devices being installed, or by inside
                    wiremen.Electricians are trained to one of three levels: Apprentice, Journeyperson, and Master
                    Electrician. In the US and Canada, apprentices work and receive a reduced compensation while
                    learning their trade. They generally take several hundred hours of classroom instruction and are
                    contracted to follow apprenticeship </p>
